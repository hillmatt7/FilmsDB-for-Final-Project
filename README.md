# FilmsDB-for-Final-Project

This is a final project for DBMS 370. The tables we are using are :
  1. Films
  2. Directors
  3. Screenings
  4. Venues
  5. Tickets
  6. Buyer
  7. Buys

The goal behind this project is to simulate a movie system throughout different venues and tracking the purchases for movies at different screenings which are held at venues.
